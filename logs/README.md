# Logs

We saved the output logs from our implementation as well as sklearn, tensorflow,
keras, etc.

The deep learning models were run on a vm instance on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
and they took a long time to finish. We saved the output logs in this folder to
further analyse the training process. Ex: steps, validation accuracy, time
measurements etc.
